## About Caching (Please Read)

For now, Bento's script is personalized and dynamic meaning that it changes on every page load. This is necessary to power our on-page personalization engine and a lot of the magic that's under the hood. Please make sure you exclude your custom Bento.js script if you are using a caching plugin such as WP Rocket or SuperCache.
